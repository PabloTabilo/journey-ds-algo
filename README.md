# Data Structures Problems
## Union and Find
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-walk-in-weighted-graph/description/

## Segment Tree
### booleans data
* https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-ii/description/
### sum subsequence with a condition
* https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-subsequence-with-non-adjacent-elements/description/

## Graph Problems
### Number nodes of max cycle vs two-component cycle + list from each node
