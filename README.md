## Modular Exponentiation
Imagine you need to compute a value $a^e$ where $a>0$ and $e$ is a large positive integer. Calculating this directly can result in excessively large numbers, leading to overflow errors. To avoid this, we use modular arithmetic, where the result is calculated modulo a given number $m$. In mathematical terms, we aim to compute:

$$a^e \mod m$$

Where:
* $a>0$ and $e>0$, both are integers.
* $m$ is the modulus, typically chosen to constrain the result within manageable bounds.
### Why Modular Exponentiation ?
For example, $2^{1000}$. Calculating this value directly would involve a massive number, making it computationally infeasible due to both time complexity and memory constraints. Modular exponentiation is a technique designed to handle this efficiently.

### The Logic behind
The method relies on divide-and-conquer principles while leveraging properties of modular arithmetic to simplify intermediate results. This approach reduces the computational complexity from $O(e)$ to $O(\log e )$, making it significantly faster.

Letâ€™s break it down using an example: compute $2^9 \pmod{10^9 + 1}$.

We know:

$$2^9 = 2\cdot2^8 = 2\cdot(2^4)^2$$

The idea is to take advantage of the parity (odd or even nature) of the exponent.
* if $e$ is odd, $a^e = a\cdot a^{e-1}$.
* if $e$ is even, $a^e = (a^{e/2})^2$.

This recursive pattern forms the basis of the iterative implementation of modular exponentiation.

```c++
long long modularExponentiation(long long base, long long exp, long long mod){
    long long result = 1;
    while(exp > 0){
        if(exp % 2 == 1){
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp /= 2;
    }
    return result;
}
```

We need use this technique, but it's not the complete concept to understand the problem:

### Fermat's Little Theorem
If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer such that $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then:

$$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$

#### Modular Inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
The above theorem can be rearranged to give the modular inverse of $a$:

$$a^{-1} \equiv a^{p-2} \pmod{p}$$

This allows us to calculate the inverse of $a$ under modulo $p$, which is useful for division in modular arithmetic.
