# A Journey Through DS and Algorithms: With C++ Template Reference, notes and Problem Insights
Various algorithm and data structure implementations that I discover while participating in contests or solving problems.
This is an open-access web book documenting my journey to deeply learn data structures and algorithms. You will find theorem definitions, problems where these theorems can be applied, and references to other sites or books.
The site is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), so you can also run it locally.

The C++ templates can be found in the `templates-cpp` folder located in the root directory. You can access it directly here:, [templates-cpp](https://github.com/PabloTabilo/journey-ds-algo/tree/main/templates-cpp).

Here is the link to the online book: [journey-ds-algo](https://pablotabilo.github.io/journey-ds-algo/)
