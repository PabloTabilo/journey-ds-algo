# Dynamic Programming Problems

To understand this type of problem, the first step is to identified the characteristics. For example:
* It's a __maximum__ / __minimum__ problem?
* Do I need to __count__ a number of events?
* Can this problem be solve using __recursion__?
* Does the solution follow the __same__ properties or structure, __independent__ of the problem's `size`?
* In your implementation on the recursive function, is there a specific __order__ require to process the solution?
