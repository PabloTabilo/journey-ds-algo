# Dynamic Programming Problems

To understand this type of problem, the first step is to identified the characteristics. For example:
* It's a _maximum / minimum_ problem? (__Optimal substructure__)
* Do I need to _count the number of ways_ for a specific events? (__Combinatorics__)
* Can this problem be solve using __recursion__?
* Does the problem follow the __same__ properties or structure, __independent__ of the problem's `size`? (__Overlapping subproblems__)
* In your implementation on the recursive function, is there a specific __order__ require to process the solution?
